# The SpankBank 🏦

!!! Important
    **Before you Stake**: Please read and understand the following SpankBank quirks and caveats! Staking in the SpankBank ***requires active participation***.

    - An address can only stake **once**. Ever.
    - The SpankBank and every staker operate on the same global clock broken into **30-day periods**.
    - Your stake will begin at the start of the **following** period.
    - You **cannot** withdraw SPANK at any point during the stake.
    - Check-ins begin at the start of the **following** period.
    - You **must** have checked-in for the period to be able to claim its BOOTY.
    - Check-ins require an Ethereum transaction (and its fee), but you can also extend your stake in that same transaction.
    - The amount of SPANK counted towards your stake will drop 5% each period _unless_ you choose to extend your stake when checking in.
    - Staking longer will allow more of your SPANK to be counted towards the stake. (See [SpankPoints](#spankpoints))

|             6               |              70%         |
|             5               |              65%         |
|             4               |              60%         |
|             3               |              55%         |
|             2               |              50%         |
|             1               |              45%         |

In order to earn the maximum BOOTY 🍑, a staker would need to stake for 12 periods, and then opt to extend their stake by 1 period during every check in.

If a staker stakes for 12 periods but doesn't opt to extend their stake during check ins, they would receive 100% of the BOOTY 🍑 for the first period, 95% for the second period, and so forth until they receive 45% during the final period.
